# Markets, Everywhere

1. Amazon: Market enabled by technological advances
   - Improved an existing market
   - Reputation system
2. Google/Facebook
   - market for advertising (huge market)
   - added new functionality to it
3. Uber / Lyft (markets for rides)
   - made an existing market much bigger
   - convinience
4. Airbnb (market for spare rooms)
5. eBay - market for second hand stuff
6. StubHub - market for second hand tickets
7. Upwork, Fiverr etc (marker for temp/freelance jobs)
8. Tinder etc (market for dates)

## Centralised vs Decentralised Markets

- _Centralised Market_: transactions dictated by platform (e.g. centrally planned economy)

  - Uber / Lyft (Why does these companies maintain Reputation System)

- _Decentralised Market_: participants are free to transact directly (e.g U.S college admissions)

- _In-between_: platform recommended transactions, bacthed transactions
  - rider- driver matching in uber:
    - greedy matching prior to 2017 (can result in more waiting time for riders)
    - Batch incoming requests for say 10secs
  - Reimagning the NYSE
    - Currently: transactions executed immediately, first come - first serve
    - Issue: high frequency trading
    - 2010: Spread networks invests $300M to save 3ms in round trip time

Question: better design of the NYSE
Idea: [Eric Budish/Peter Cramton/John Shim 2013](https://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/eric.budish/research/HFT-FrequentBatchAuctions.pdf) process buy/sell orders in batches, compute a common clearing price
