_Abstract_: In this blog we are going to learn about databases.

# Table of contents

# ACID

When you generally talk to database people, one will come across ACID pretty soon. ACID is an acronymn which stands for 4 concepts, namely Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.

# Indexes and Indexing

Creating an `Index` on a particular attribute of the table.

```sql
CREATE INDEX users_username_idx ON users(username);
```

The default naming convention of index names is `{tablename}_{attribute_name}_idx`. This name is assigned if none given at the time of creating index.

Now that we have created an Index, how do we find the size of it ?

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users_username_idx'));
```

In our database example it is `184kb`;

To delete an index, we do

```sql
DROP INDEX users_username_idx;
```

There are many different types of indexes in Postgress. Most of the time you need B+tree indexes. Different types of Indexes are:

- **B-Tree**: Genereal purpose index, 99% of the time you need this.
- **Hash**: Speeds up simple equality checks.
- **GiST**: Geometry, full text search.
- **SP-GiST**: Clustered data, such as dates - many rows habe the same year.
- **GIN**: For columns that contain arrays or JSON.
- **BRIN**: Specialized for really large datasets.

There are some indexes created by Postgress automatically. Postgress automatically creates an index for the `primary key` of every table. It also creates an index for any `UNIQUE` constraint. These don't get listed in pgAdmin. So, how do we find them ? `pg_class` table to the rescue.

```sql
SELECT relname, relkind
FROM pg_class
WHERE relkind='i';
```

We have seen how to create an index, how to measure it's size, how to delete them and also figure out how to check automatically created indexes by Postgree.

# Query Tuning

We can write queries with below keywords and get back some information which will give us the performance numbers.

- EXPLAIN: Build a query plan and display information about it
- EXPLAIN ANALYZE: Build a query plan, run it and siplay information about it

pg_stats table maintained by Postgres.

From the result of EXPLAIN or EXPLAIN ANALYZE, we can inspect following characterstic fo each node.

- cost: Amount of processing power required for the particular node stage
- rows: How many rows will this step produce (guess)
- width: Average number of bytes for each row (guess)

# Getting random rows from a table

Getting a single random row, or a few rows, from a table in order to get representative data for example is a frequent need. Learn the answers [here](https://blog.hagander.net/getting-random-rows-faster-very-much-faster-249/)

# Building an Express api with Postgres

Please see [pg-simple-api](https://github.com/vineet-codes/pg-simple-api). This is a template i use for quick prototying tasks which can scale to decent traffic.

# SQL based data science
